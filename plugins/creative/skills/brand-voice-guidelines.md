# Brand Voice Guidelines

## Purpose
Define and maintain a consistent brand personality across all written communications, ensuring every piece of content sounds authentically "on-brand."

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1: Brand Voice Discovery
1. **Audit existing content** - Review 10-20 pieces of current brand content
2. **Identify patterns** - Note recurring phrases, tone shifts, inconsistencies
3. **Interview stakeholders** - Gather input on how the brand should "feel"
4. **Competitive analysis** - Map competitor voices to find differentiation

### Step 2: Define Voice Dimensions
Rate each dimension on a spectrum (1-5):

| Dimension | 1 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|
| Formality | Casual, conversational | Professional, authoritative |
| Humor | Serious, straightforward | Playful, witty |
| Enthusiasm | Reserved, measured | Energetic, passionate |
| Complexity | Simple, accessible | Technical, sophisticated |
| Warmth | Distant, objective | Personal, empathetic |

### Step 3: Create Voice Character Profile
```markdown
## Brand Voice Profile: [Brand Name]

**If our brand were a person, they would be:**
[2-3 sentence character description]

**They would say things like:**
- "[Example phrase 1]"
- "[Example phrase 2]"
- "[Example phrase 3]"

**They would NEVER say:**
- "[Anti-example 1]"
- "[Anti-example 2]"
```

### Step 4: Document Vocabulary Guidelines

#### Preferred Terms
| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Purchase | Get, grab, snag |
| Utilize | Use |
| Commence | Start, begin |
| [Add brand-specific terms] | |

#### Power Words (Brand-Approved)
- [List 10-15 words that embody the brand]

#### Forbidden Words
- [Words that conflict with brand values]

### Step 5: Create Channel-Specific Adaptations

| Channel | Tone Adjustment | Max Length | Special Considerations |
|---------|-----------------|------------|------------------------|
| Website | Core voice | Varies | SEO keywords integrated naturally |
| Email | +10% warmth | 150 words max | Personal, action-oriented |
| Social | +20% casual | Platform limits | Hashtag strategy |
| Support | +15% empathy | As needed | Solution-focused |

## Decision Criteria

### When to adjust voice:
- **Crisis communication**: Dial back humor, increase empathy
- **Technical content**: Allow more complexity, maintain personality
- **Sales content**: Increase enthusiasm within brand limits
- **Legal/compliance**: Formality takes precedence

### Voice consistency checks:
- [ ] Does this sound like our brand character?
- [ ] Would this feel jarring next to other brand content?
- [ ] Are we using approved vocabulary?
- [ ] Is the formality level appropriate for the channel?

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-documentation** - Creating so many rules that writers feel paralyzed
2. **Ignoring context** - Applying same voice to funeral home as to party brand
3. **Voice drift** - Allowing gradual changes without updating documentation
4. **Inconsistent enforcement** - Different standards for different writers
5. **Forgetting audience** - Voice should resonate with customers, not just brand
6. **Mimicking competitors** - Differentiation matters more than convention
7. **Static guidelines** - Voice should evolve with brand maturity

## Maintenance Schedule

- **Monthly**: Review new content for consistency
- **Quarterly**: Update vocabulary lists
- **Annually**: Full voice audit and stakeholder review
- **As needed**: Channel-specific updates for new platforms
