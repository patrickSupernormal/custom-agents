| Trust | Proven, guaranteed, certified, backed, tested |
| Curiosity | Surprising, unexpected, little-known, strange |
| Value | Free, bonus, complete, ultimate, essential |
| Fear | Avoid, never, warning, mistake, risk |

### Step 2: Body Copy Frameworks

#### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)
```markdown
**Problem**: Identify the pain point
"You're spending hours on content that nobody reads."

**Agitate**: Make it feel urgent
"Every ignored post is wasted time, money, and energy. Meanwhile, competitors are stealing your audience."

**Solve**: Present your solution
"Our content strategy framework ensures every piece you create serves a purpose and reaches the right people."
```

#### AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)
```markdown
**Attention**: Hook them immediately
"What if you could double your conversion rate?"

**Interest**: Build curiosity
"We analyzed 10,000 landing pages to find what actually works."

**Desire**: Create want
"Imagine launching pages that convert from day one."

**Action**: Tell them what to do
"Get the free playbook now."
```

#### BAB (Before-After-Bridge)
```markdown
**Before**: Current painful state
"Right now, you're guessing which content to create."

**After**: Desired future state
"Imagine having a clear roadmap that shows exactly what to publish and when."

**Bridge**: How to get there
"Our content calendar template makes strategic planning effortless."
```

#### 4 Ps (Promise-Picture-Proof-Push)
```markdown
**Promise**: Make a bold claim
"Triple your email open rates in 30 days."

**Picture**: Paint the outcome
"Imagine seeing 40%+ open rates on every campaign you send."

**Proof**: Back it up
"Over 500 marketers have used this framework to transform their email performance."

**Push**: Call to action
"Start your free trial today."
```

### Step 3: CTA Writing

#### CTA Formula
```
[Action Verb] + [Value/Outcome] + [Urgency Optional]
```

#### Button Copy Rules
- Start with action verb
- Use first person ("My" not "Your")
- Include value proposition
- Create urgency when appropriate
- Keep under 5 words
- Test variations

### Step 4: Conversion Copy Patterns

#### Social Proof Formats
```markdown
**Testimonial**: "[Quote]" - Name, Title, Company

**Data Point**: "Join 10,000+ marketers who..."

**Logo Bar**: "Trusted by teams at [Logo] [Logo] [Logo]"

**Case Study Teaser**: "How [Company] achieved [Result] in [Time]"

**Rating**: "Rated 4.9/5 by 500+ customers"
```

#### Urgency & Scarcity (Use Ethically)
```markdown
**Time-based**: "Offer ends Friday"
**Quantity-based**: "Only 5 spots remaining"
**Conditional**: "Price increases after launch"
**Social proof urgency**: "127 people viewing this now"
```

#### Objection Handling Copy
```markdown
**Risk reversal**: "30-day money-back guarantee"
**FAQ format**: "Will this work for [specific case]?"
**Comparison**: "Unlike [Alternative], we [Differentiator]"
**Trust signals**: "256-bit encryption | SOC2 compliant"
```

### Step 5: Microcopy

#### Form Field Labels
| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Email Address | Work Email |
| Submit | [Context-specific action] |
| Password | Create Password |
| Error | [Specific helpful message] |

#### Error Messages
```
Pattern: [What happened] + [How to fix it]
"That email is already registered. Try logging in or use a different email."
```

#### Empty States
```
Pattern: [Acknowledge] + [Guide] + [Encourage]
"No projects yet. Create your first project to get started. It only takes 2 minutes."
```

## Templates

### Landing Page Copy Framework
```markdown
## Hero Section
Headline: [Primary benefit + differentiator]
Subhead: [Support headline, add specificity]
CTA: [Action + value]
Social proof: [One strong proof point]

## Problem Section
[Describe pain points - 3 bullet points max]

## Solution Section
[How you solve it - benefit-focused]

## Features/Benefits
[3-5 key features with benefit framing]

## Social Proof
[Testimonials, logos, case studies]

## FAQ
[4-6 common objections as questions]

## Final CTA
[Repeat primary CTA with urgency]
```

## Decision Criteria

### When to use each framework:
- **PAS**: Pain-point heavy, emotional decisions
- **AIDA**: Linear buyer journey, considered purchases
- **BAB**: Transformation stories, before/after scenarios
- **4 Ps**: Skeptical audiences needing proof

### Tone adjustments:
- **B2B**: More formal, ROI-focused, longer consideration
- **B2C**: More emotional, lifestyle-focused, quicker action
- **SaaS**: Benefit-heavy, feature explanation, trial emphasis
- **E-commerce**: Urgency, reviews, product details

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Feature-focused copy** - Benefits sell, features inform
2. **Vague CTAs** - "Submit" tells nothing about value
3. **Jargon overload** - Clarity beats cleverness
4. **Missing proof** - Claims without evidence fail
5. **Weak headlines** - 80% read headline, 20% read body
6. **No clear next step** - Every section needs direction
7. **Ignoring objections** - Address concerns before they arise
8. **Generic testimonials** - Specific results beat general praise
9. **Over-promising** - Credibility loss destroys conversion
10. **Single CTA** - Long pages need multiple entry points
