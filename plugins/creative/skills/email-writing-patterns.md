# Email Writing Patterns

## Purpose
Craft clear, effective, and appropriately-toned professional emails that achieve their communication goals across all business contexts.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1: Email Structure Frameworks

#### Standard Professional Email Structure
```
1. Subject Line - Clear, specific, actionable
2. Greeting - Appropriate for relationship
3. Opening Hook - Context or purpose statement
4. Body - Key information (1-3 paragraphs max)
5. Call to Action - Clear next step
6. Closing - Professional sign-off
7. Signature - Name, title, contact info
```

#### The BRIEF Framework
```markdown
**B**ottom Line Up Front - Lead with your main point
**R**elevant Context - Only what recipient needs
**I**nformation - Supporting details
**E**xpected Action - What you need from them
**F**ollow-up Plan - When/how you'll reconnect
```

#### The 5-Sentence Email (For Busy Recipients)
```markdown
Sentence 1: Context/Reference
Sentence 2: Purpose/Request
Sentence 3: Key detail or rationale
Sentence 4: Specific action needed
Sentence 5: Timeline/Next step
```

#### The Inverted Pyramid
```
[MOST IMPORTANT]
     Main point, decision needed, or key news
           [SUPPORTING DETAILS]
              Context, background, rationale
                   [ADDITIONAL INFO]
                      Links, attachments, FYI items
```

### Step 2: Subject Line Formulas

#### Subject Line Patterns by Purpose

| Purpose | Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Request | [Topic]: [Specific Ask] | "Budget Approval: Q4 Marketing Request" |
| Update | [Project]: [Status] Update | "Website Redesign: Phase 1 Complete" |
| Meeting | [Meeting Type]: [Topic] - [Date] | "1:1 Meeting: Q3 Goals Review - Oct 15" |
| Action Required | Action Required: [Task] by [Date] | "Action Required: Contract Review by Friday" |
| FYI/No Response | FYI: [Topic Summary] | "FYI: New Expense Policy Effective Nov 1" |
| Follow-up | Following Up: [Original Topic] | "Following Up: Partnership Proposal" |
| Introduction | Introduction: [Person] <> [Person] | "Introduction: Sarah Chen <> Mike Ross" |
| Urgent | URGENT: [Brief Description] | "URGENT: Server Outage - Action Needed" |

#### Subject Line Power Words
```
Specific: "Q3" not "Quarterly"
Actionable: "Review", "Approve", "Confirm"
Time-bound: "by EOD", "by Friday", "for Monday"
Clear: "Decision Needed" not "Thoughts?"
```

#### Subject Lines to Avoid
```
- "Quick question" (not specific)
- "Hey" or "Hi" (unprofessional)
- "URGENT!!!!" (overused, ignored)
- "Follow up" (lacks context)
- "[No subject]" (always include one)
- ALL CAPS (reads as shouting)
```

### Step 3: Opening Hooks by Context

#### First Contact Openings
```markdown
**Mutual Connection**
"[Name] suggested I reach out regarding your work on [topic]."

**Shared Context**
"I enjoyed your presentation at [event] on [topic]."

**Research-Based**
"I noticed [company] recently [achievement/news], and I thought..."

**Value Lead**
"I have an idea that could help [company] achieve [specific outcome]."
```

#### Existing Relationship Openings
```markdown
**Positive Continuation**
"Great speaking with you yesterday about [topic]."

**Direct Purpose**
"I'm writing to follow up on [previous discussion/action item]."

**Appreciation First**
"Thank you for [specific action/support/time]."

**News Hook**
"I wanted to share some updates on [project/topic]."
```

#### Context-Specific Openers

| Situation | Opening Line |
|-----------|--------------|
| Cold outreach | "[Specific observation about them/company] caught my attention." |
| Follow-up | "Following up on [specific topic] from our [meeting/call/email]." |
| Request | "I'm reaching out because I need your help with [specific thing]." |
| Good news | "I'm pleased to share that [achievement/update]." |
| Bad news | "I want to update you on [topic] and share some challenges we've encountered." |
| Introduction | "I'd like to introduce you to [Name], who [relevant context]." |
| Thank you | "Thank you for [specific action]. It made a real difference in [outcome]." |
| Apology | "I want to apologize for [specific issue] and explain how we're addressing it." |

#### Avoid These Openers
```
- "I hope this email finds you well" (generic, overused)
- "I know you're busy, but..." (undermines your message)
- "Per my last email..." (passive-aggressive)
- "Sorry to bother you" (diminishes your request)
- "Just checking in" (lacks purpose)
```

### Step 4: Body Copy Patterns

#### The SCRAP Method for Requests
```markdown
**S**ituation: Brief context
**C**omplication: Why you need help
**R**equest: Specific ask
**A**ction: What they need to do
**P**ayoff: Benefit to them or outcome
```

Example:
```markdown
We're launching the new product line next month (situation), but we've hit a snag
with the marketing materials approval process (complication). Could you expedite
the review of the three campaigns in your queue? (request) I've flagged them as
priority in the system (action). This will ensure we hit our launch date and
the Q4 revenue targets we discussed (payoff).
```

#### Structuring Complex Information
```markdown
**Use bullets for**:
- Lists of 3+ items
- Action items or deliverables
- Options for decisions

**Use numbered lists for**:
1. Sequential steps
2. Priority-ranked items
3. Process instructions

**Use tables for**:
| Option | Cost | Timeline | Recommendation |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| A | $5K | 2 weeks | Best value |
| B | $8K | 1 week | Fastest |
```

#### Paragraph Patterns
```markdown
**Single Topic Rule**
Each paragraph = one idea. New topic = new paragraph.

**Ideal Length**
- 2-4 sentences per paragraph
- 3-5 paragraphs maximum for standard emails
- Use white space liberally

**Scannable Format**
[Bold key terms] for skimmers
Use headers for long emails
Front-load important information
```

### Step 5: CTA Placement and Wording

#### CTA Formulas
```markdown
**Specific + Timeline**
"Please review and approve by end of day Thursday."

**Action + Method**
"Reply to this email with your preferred meeting time."

**Conditional**
"If you agree, please forward to [person] for final sign-off."

**Soft Ask**
"Let me know if you have any questions or concerns."

**Hard Ask**
"I need your decision by [date] to proceed."
```

#### CTA Placement Strategies
```markdown
**Short Emails (< 5 sentences)**
- Place CTA in final sentence
- Can repeat in P.S. for emphasis

**Medium Emails (1-3 paragraphs)**
- Preview CTA in opening
- Detail in body
- Restate clearly at end

**Long Emails (4+ paragraphs)**
- State CTA immediately after opening
- Reference in relevant body sections
- Summarize all CTAs at bottom
```

#### CTA Language by Urgency

| Urgency Level | Wording |
|---------------|---------|
| Low | "When you have a moment, could you..." |
| Medium | "Please [action] by end of week." |
| High | "I need [action] by [specific date/time]." |
| Urgent | "This is time-sensitive. Please [action] today." |
| Critical | "URGENT: [Action] required immediately to prevent [consequence]." |

#### Weak vs Strong CTAs
| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Let me know" | "Please confirm by Friday" |
| "Thoughts?" | "Which option do you prefer: A or B?" |
| "Get back to me" | "Reply with your availability for Tuesday or Wednesday" |
| "ASAP" | "By 3pm EST today" |

### Step 6: Tone Adjustment by Audience

#### Tone Spectrum
```
FORMAL ←――――――――――――――――――――――――――――→ CASUAL

Executive/Legal    Client    Colleague    Team    Close Peer
  ↓                  ↓          ↓          ↓         ↓
"Dear Mr. Smith"  "Hello"   "Hi Sarah"  "Hey"   "Quick q:"
```

#### Formal Tone Markers
```markdown
**Use When**: C-suite, legal, external stakeholders, complaints, contracts

**Characteristics**:

- "Dear [Title] [Last Name]"
- "I am writing to inform you..."

```

**Example - Formal**:

Hi Jennifer,

Thanks for the quick turnaround on the design files. The team is excited

Can you send me the revised timeline when you get a chance? No rush, just
need it before our Thursday standup.

Thanks!
[Name]
```

Hi David,

I understand how frustrating this delay must be, especially given your tight
timeline. You're right to be disappointed - this isn't the level of service
we committed to.

Here's what we're doing to make this right:
- Expediting your order with overnight shipping at no additional cost
- Applying a 20% credit to your next purchase
- Assigning a dedicated contact for your account going forward

I'll personally follow up on Friday to confirm delivery.

Sincerely,
[Name]
```

### Step 7: Follow-Up Email Sequences

## Decision Criteria

### When to use each tone:
- **Formal**: Legal matters, executives, complaints, external high-stakes
- **Semi-formal**: Clients, vendors, cross-functional partners
- **Casual**: Internal team, established relationships, quick exchanges
- **Empathetic**: Apologies, sensitive topics, bad news, complaints

### When to send vs. call:
| Send Email | Make a Call |
|------------|-------------|
| Need written record | Delivering bad news |
| Complex details to reference | Emotional/sensitive topics |
| Multiple recipients | Need immediate response |
| Asynchronous is fine | Relationship building |
| Non-urgent requests | Complex negotiations |

### Subject line requirements by priority:
- **Low priority**: Descriptive, no time markers
- **Medium priority**: Include deadline if relevant
- **High priority**: "Action Required" + specific deadline
- **Urgent**: "URGENT" (use sparingly) + time-sensitive language

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Burying the lead** - Put your main point in the first two sentences
2. **Wall of text** - Use white space, bullets, and short paragraphs
3. **Vague subject lines** - Be specific about topic and action needed
4. **No clear CTA** - Every email should have an obvious next step
5. **Wrong tone** - Match formality to relationship and context
6. **Overexplaining** - Be concise; details can come in follow-up
7. **Reply-all abuse** - Only include necessary recipients
8. **Passive voice** - "The report was completed" vs "I completed the report"
9. **Emotional sending** - Draft, wait, review before sending difficult emails
10. **Missing context** - Don't assume recipients remember previous threads
11. **Weak asks** - "Thoughts?" is not a CTA; be specific about what you need
12. **Apologizing unnecessarily** - "Sorry to bother you" weakens your message
