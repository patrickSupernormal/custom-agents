# Content Strategy Framework

## Purpose
Create a structured approach to content planning that aligns business goals with user needs, ensuring every piece of content serves a strategic purpose.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1: Content Audit
1. **Inventory existing content** - Catalog all pages, assets, and materials
2. **Assess performance** - Traffic, engagement, conversion metrics
3. **Evaluate quality** - Accuracy, relevance, brand alignment
4. **Identify gaps** - Missing topics, stages, or audience segments

### Step 2: Define Content Pillars
Content pillars are 3-5 core themes that all content maps back to.

```markdown
## Content Pillar Framework

### Pillar 1: [Theme]
- Purpose: [Why this matters to the brand]
- Audience need: [What users seek]
- Content types: [Blog, video, guide, etc.]
- Keywords: [Primary terms]

### Pillar 2: [Theme]
[Repeat structure]
```

### Step 3: Map Content to User Journey

| Stage | User Intent | Content Types | Key Messages | CTAs |
|-------|-------------|---------------|--------------|------|
| Awareness | Learning, exploring | Blog, social, video | Problem validation | Learn more |
| Consideration | Comparing, evaluating | Guides, comparisons, case studies | Differentiation | See how |
| Decision | Ready to act | Pricing, demos, testimonials | Trust, urgency | Get started |
| Retention | Using, optimizing | Tutorials, support, updates | Value reinforcement | Upgrade, refer |
| Advocacy | Sharing, recommending | Reviews, community, UGC | Recognition | Share, review |

### Step 4: Establish Content Hierarchy

#### Page-Level Hierarchy
```
H1: Primary topic (1 per page)
├── H2: Major sections (3-7 per page)
│   ├── H3: Subsections (as needed)
│   │   └── H4: Detailed points (sparingly)
│   └── H3: Another subsection
└── H2: Another major section
```

#### Site-Level Hierarchy
```
Homepage (Tier 1)
├── Pillar Pages (Tier 2) - Core themes
│   ├── Cluster Content (Tier 3) - Supporting articles
│   │   └── Detail Pages (Tier 4) - Specific topics
```

### Step 5: Create Content Briefs

## Content Brief Template
```markdown
# Content Brief: [Title]

## Basics
- **Type**: [Blog/Landing/Guide/etc.]
- **Pillar**: [Which content pillar]
- **Journey Stage**: [Awareness/Consideration/Decision]
- **Target Audience**: [Specific persona]
- **Target Length**: [Word count range]

## SEO Requirements
- **Primary Keyword**: [term]
- **Secondary Keywords**: [2-5 terms]
- **Search Intent**: [Informational/Commercial/Transactional]

## Content Structure
1. [Section 1 - what to cover]
2. [Section 2 - what to cover]
3. [Section 3 - what to cover]

## Key Messages
- [Message 1]
- [Message 2]

## Required Elements
- [ ] Hero image
- [ ] 2-3 supporting images
- [ ] Internal links: [list pages]
- [ ] CTA: [specific action]

## Competitive Reference
- [URL 1] - [what to do better]
- [URL 2] - [what to do better]

## Success Metrics
- [Traffic target]
- [Engagement target]
- [Conversion target]
```

### Step 6: Plan Content Calendar

| Week | Content Piece | Pillar | Stage | Owner | Status |
|------|---------------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | [Title] | [Pillar] | [Stage] | [Name] | Draft |
| 2 | [Title] | [Pillar] | [Stage] | [Name] | Review |

## Decision Criteria

### Content prioritization matrix:
| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Business impact | 30% | |
| User demand (search volume) | 25% | |
| Competitive gap | 20% | |
| Production effort | 15% | |
| Content longevity | 10% | |

### When to create new vs. update existing:
- **Create new**: Unique angle, new topic, specific campaign
- **Update existing**: Same intent, outdated info, underperforming

### Content retirement criteria:
- No traffic for 6+ months
- Information is obsolete
- Conflicts with current brand/product
- Cannibalizing better content

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Strategy without execution** - Plans that never become content
2. **Ignoring search intent** - Creating what you want vs. what users seek
3. **Pillar sprawl** - Too many themes diluting focus
4. **Calendar rigidity** - Missing timely opportunities for scheduled content
5. **Quantity over quality** - Publishing frequency trumping value
6. **Siloed content** - No internal linking or content relationships
7. **No measurement** - Publishing without tracking performance
8. **Persona neglect** - Writing for everyone, resonating with no one
