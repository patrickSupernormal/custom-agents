## Decision Criteria

### When to escalate:
- Scope changes exceeding 20% of original
- Client unresponsive for 5+ business days
- Conflicting stakeholder feedback
- Budget concerns before overage
- Timeline at risk by 1+ week

### Communication channel selection:
| Situation | Channel |
|-----------|---------|
| Quick clarification | Slack/Teams |
| Detailed feedback | Email with doc |
| Complex discussion | Video call |
| Bad news | Call first, email recap |
| Celebration | Personal message + team CC |

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Jargon overload** - Clients don't speak agency/dev language
2. **Assumption without confirmation** - Always verify understanding
3. **Delayed bad news** - Proactive beats reactive
4. **Missing documentation** - Verbal agreements need written follow-up
5. **One-way updates** - Invite dialogue, don't just broadcast
6. **Unclear next steps** - Every communication needs an action
7. **Over-explaining** - Concise beats comprehensive
8. **Wrong audience** - Tailor detail level to recipient
9. **Emotional responses** - Professional tone in difficult moments
10. **No paper trail** - Document decisions and approvals
