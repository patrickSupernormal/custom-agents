# Research Methodology

## Overview

Structured approach to conducting research that ensures comprehensive coverage, credible sourcing, and actionable insights.

---

## Phase 1: Define Research Parameters

### Question Formulation
1. Convert vague requests into specific research questions
2. Identify the decision the research will inform
3. Define success criteria for the research output

### Scope Boundaries
```
PRIMARY: Must answer these questions
├── Core question 1
├── Core question 2
└── Core question 3

SECONDARY: Nice to have if time permits
├── Supporting question 1
└── Supporting question 2

OUT OF SCOPE: Explicitly excluded
└── Topics to avoid
```

## Phase 2: Source Strategy

### Source Tiers (Prioritize Higher Tiers)

| Tier | Source Type | Credibility | Example |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Primary/Official | Highest | Official docs, company sites |
| 2 | Expert/Industry | High | Industry reports, expert blogs |
| 3 | Aggregated | Medium | Review sites, comparison tools |
| 4 | Community | Variable | Forums, Reddit, comments |
| 5 | AI-Generated | Lowest | Summaries, generated content |

### Minimum Source Requirements
- **Factual claims**: 2+ Tier 1-2 sources
- **Trends/opinions**: 3+ sources across tiers
- **Competitive data**: Primary source + 2 validating sources

---

## Phase 3: Research Execution

### Search Strategy Template
```
1. Start broad: [topic] overview
2. Narrow focus: [topic] + [specific aspect]
3. Find alternatives: [topic] vs [competitor]
4. Validate: [topic] reviews | problems | issues
5. Recent updates: [topic] 2024 | latest | new
```

### Information Capture Framework
For each finding, record:
- **Claim**: What is being stated
- **Source**: URL and source tier
- **Date**: When published/updated
- **Confidence**: High/Medium/Low
- **Conflicts**: Any contradicting information

---

## Phase 4: Synthesis

### Cross-Reference Checklist
- [ ] Multiple sources confirm key facts
- [ ] Contradictions are noted and explained
- [ ] Gaps in research are acknowledged
- [ ] Recency of information is considered

### Output Template
```markdown
## Research Summary: [Topic]

### Key Findings
1. [Finding with confidence level]
2. [Finding with confidence level]

### Implications
- [What this means for the project]

### Uncertainties
- [Areas needing more research]

### Sources
- [Tier 1 sources]
- [Tier 2 sources]
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Prevention |
|---------|------------|
| Confirmation bias | Search for contradicting evidence |
| Outdated info | Check publication dates, filter by recency |
| Single source reliance | Require 2+ sources for claims |
| Over-research | Set time limits, stay within scope |
| Shallow research | Follow links, read beyond summaries |

---

## Quality Checklist

Before submitting research:
- [ ] All research questions answered
- [ ] Sources meet minimum tier requirements
- [ ] Contradictions addressed
- [ ] Confidence levels assigned
- [ ] Actionable recommendations included
- [ ] Time spent is proportionate to importance
